        <p>I am from Queens, NY. I moved from NewYork to Karachi, Pakistan when I was only 4-5 years old. I studied there till 11th grade.
        I came back to United States before I could finish my highschool. When I got here, I didn't want to go to school because of the language barrier. I was not confident to engage with people and talk in english yet.
        So I took GED classes at Thomas Dale High School. I passed all GED tests within 6 months.</p>

        <p>After GED, I went to John Tyler Community College for Associates. It took me three and a half years to get my associates degree because of langauge issues which left me often far behind the class and I ended up failing or getting low grades in many of my classes.
        Anyhow, I finished my Associates and now I am in University of Richmond trying to learn web development for the better career and life overall.
        I also want to continue studying in the future along with working full time. I have plans to complete bachelors while working as a developer hopefully after I get done with this Coding Bootcamp.</p>

        <p>Enough about education and my future. Let me tell you about my hobbies. During the day, I love to either go swimming or go to gym. At night, usually I like to hangout with friends and do anything from playing cards/xbox or clubbing and grab some to eat afterwards.</p>
